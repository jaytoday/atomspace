; copy-on-write.scm -- Copy-on-write into overlay AtomSpaces.
;
; This demonstrates how to create a pair of AtomSpaces, one layered
; on the other, so that changes are limited to the upper layer, leaving
; the base layer undisturbed.  There are two distinct ways of doing
; this. One is to explicitly mark the base layer as read-only. The
; other is to mark the overlay copy-on-write (while leaving the base
; writable.)
;
; There are several expected use cases. The copy-on-write mechanism
; provides a very simple way to create "scratch" or temporary spaces,
; where calculations can be performed, without altering the base space.
;
; The read-only mechanism is a primitive permission system, and can be
; used to implement shared use. One example would be a large read-only
; database holding data that is shared by many people. Individual users
; can then "mount" this database, and make local changes to it (i.e.
; perform read-write operations) without corrupting the underlying
; shared read-only database.
;
; A more advanced use is to use deep stacks of AtomSpaces to hold
; partial results arising from long computations. These can be thought
; of as a historical record or a collection of Kripke frames of the
; calculations, with each level consisting of all changes between that
; and the previous level: a "changeset", similar to that in git.
; Multiple branches are also allowed, and so fancy algorithms can
; perform "many-worlds" computations, and directly compare AtomSpaces
; in different branches.
;
; By default, whenever a new AtomSpace is created as a layer on top of
; another, it is marked as a copy-on-write space. This flag can be
; cleared: in this case, the overlay becomes a write-through AtomSpace.
; Newly-created Atoms will still be created in the overlay, but changes
; to Values and TruthValues of Atoms in the base space will pass through,
; to the base space. This demo does not show the write-through ability;
; the user is encourage to explore this themselves.

; The overlay contains only the modified atom.

; Create a Link, and verify that it sits in the overlay.
; Pay attention to where the atoms in the Link sit: some will be
; in the base space, and some will be in the overlay. Which is where
; depends on how each scheme symbol got bound to an atom. This can
; be a source of confusion.

; Let's restore the base to being read-write (thus unprotected)

; Change the TV of `a` in the overlay.
(cog-set-value! a k (FloatValue 0.5 0.5))

; And a grand finale: change the TV of `b`. This will result in a
; new `b` being created in the overlay, with the new TV, while the
; original `b` remains in the base, as it was, unchanged.
