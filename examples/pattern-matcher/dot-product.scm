; dot-product.scm -- take dot products of vectors for query
;
; The QueryLink not only performs searches, but it can apply rewrite
; rules to the results. These re-write rules can generate (numeric)
; Values, which are returned to the caller.  This example illustrates
; a query that returns two vectors of numbers, which are multiplied
; and accumulated, resulting in a dot-product of the two.
