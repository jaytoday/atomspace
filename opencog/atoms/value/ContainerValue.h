/**
 * ContainerValues provide a thread-safe containers for Values. They
 * provide a producer-consumer API, where the produced values are to
 * added to the container (possibly from multiple threads) and are
 * removed by consumers (possibly in other threads.)
 *
 * It provides a uniform API for all such containers, i.e. both queues
 * and sets, for code that wants to handle either type (e.g. for
 * queries.) The add() method will append to the end of a queue,
 * or, for sets, insert into the set, while remove() will remove from
 * the head of a queue, or, for sets, remove in whatever order the set
 * pool provides (using std::less by default.)
 *
 * Semantics include open() and close(). The close() method allows the
 * producer to tell consumers that it's done adding things. i.e. its
 * an end-of-stream indicator. (XXX Maybe this should be moved to the
 * LinkStreamValue base class ??)
