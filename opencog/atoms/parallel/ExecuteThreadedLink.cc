///        ExecuteThreadedLink
///            NumberNode nthr  ; optional; if present, number of threads.
///            SetLink

///        ExecuteThreadedLink
///            NumberNode nthr  ; optional; if present, number of threads.
///            ExecutableAtoms...
///
/// When this link is executed, the `ExecutableAtoms...` are executed
/// in parallel, in distinct threads, with the result of the execution
/// appended to a thread-safe queue, the QueueValue.  The QueueValue is
/// returned immediately. The QueueValue remains open as long as threads
/// are running; it is closed only after all threads terminate.
///
/// By default, the number of threads launched equals the number of
/// Atoms in the set. If the NumberNode is present, then the number of
/// threads is the smaller of the NumberNode and the size of the Set.
///
/// XXX TODO: If nthreads = 0, just execute directly here, in the
/// current thread, and block till execution is done.
///
/// XXX TODO: Create some kind of thing that waits for the QueueValue
/// to close. This would have the effect of joining.  For example:
///    (cog-execute! (WaitForCloseLink (ExecuteThreadedLink ...)))
/// and the WaitForCloseLink just ... waits for the queue to close,
/// and returns only then. This would be generic, for all QueueValue
/// users... XXX should port BindLink etc. to this, too!?
