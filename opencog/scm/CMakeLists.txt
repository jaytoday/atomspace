# About the COMPILE flag in the macros below:
# It causes the guild compiler to run and build a compiled version of
# the module. It works. But guile does not actually use this compiled
# version, because, after install, it finds that the sources have a
# newer timestamp.  I don't feel like wrestling with this right now,
# so ... for just right now, disable this. It should be fixed and
# re-enabled.
